    <em> Tegon is AI-First Issue Tracking tool for engineering teams
</em>
</p>

[Tegon](https://tegon.ai) is an AI-first, open-source issue tracking software that uses AI to smartly automate manual task, workflows or provide more context to engineers for a given task.

Issue Tracking is important for fast-paced teams, enabling them to organize list of tasks, collaborate, and track progress effectively. However, existing tools often introduce the following challenges:

- Manual efforts in task management, such as task triaging and backlog maintenance, can be time-consuming.
- Engineers often waste time navigating multiple platforms to gather task context, rather than accessing details within the task itself.
- Issue tracking tools serve as a task database, directing engineers on what to work on but not aiding in faster task completion.
- Existing tools don't effectively assist Engineering Managers in real-time task, feature, or bug prioritisation.
