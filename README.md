    <em> Tegon is AI-First Issue Tracking tool for engineering teams
</em>
</p>

[Tegon](https://tegon.ai) is an open-source issue tracking tool for engineering teams. It is designed to be simple to use and super functional, addressing the complexities and slow nature of existing tools.

Existing tools like Jira, Asana etc often act as a blocker in engineers' productivity by adding more processes and manual tasks, and they do not help engineers in resolving the bug faster or get full context about a specific tasks. Tegon is using AI and integrations smartly to automate task creation and updation and help engineers in task prioritisation and better bug resolution

## Tegon Cloud

We offer a managed cloud version of Tegon that allows you to run Tegon without having to manage the infrastructure. It is currently in private beta. 
If you're interested in using Skyvern Cloud, please book a [demo call](https://calendly.com/manik-sync/talk-to-us)

## Features

- Issues Tracking (List and Kanban View)
- Automatic Title generation from the description
- AI generated labels and assignees
- Custom Views
- Sprints (coming soon)
- Task Prioritisation (coming soon)

## Integrations

- Github: Automatically update issues status based based on commits and pull requests and link mentions of issues back to Tegon
- Slack: Get information about mentioned work items in Slack and link Slack conversations to Tegon issues
- Sentry: Get information about Sentry errors in Tegon issues

## Agents (Coming Soon)

Large Language Models (LLMs) are significantly transforming technology development. In anticipation of AI Agents driving product management and issue tracking, we are proactively developing the following agents:

- PR Agent: This agent reviews linked pull requests (PRs) for new tasks, ensuring code quality by preventing the incorporation of suboptimal code.
- Bug Agent: Upon bug assignment, this agent will attempt to reproduce the bug, propose solutions, and in some cases, even implement these solutions in a new PR.

## Contributing

Whether it's big or small, we love contributions. Not sure where to get started? 
You can join our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/tegoncommunity/shared_invite/zt-2i1e781ip-zwauijRV9TRtRKoJi3tqng), and ask us any questions there.
